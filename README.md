# Speed-Current-Double-Closed-Loop-Based-on-Stm32f103
Speed-current double-closed-loop of DC motor using PID

The speed-current double-closed-loop using PID algorithm is located in /User/balance, and other drivers are located in /User.

This project contains speed-current double-loop PID algorithm, LCD1602 shows current speed and speed settings, matrix keyboard adjusts parameters of PID algorithm, STM32 built-in FLASH saves current parameters, speed-current curve is output to PC display through serial port, PC changes parameters of PID algorithm.
